# theodore-roosevelt-website

Create a personal website for Theodore Roosevelt with the following:

- A header with Theodore Roosevelt's name
- A footer with a placeholder copyright notice
- A main content area with a placeholder text "About Theodore Roosevelt" and some lorem ipsum text
- Some basic styling to make it look decent

Don't include too many details yet, as I still need to gather more information from the user about the specific content they want.
